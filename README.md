Aim to reduce peer-to-peer e-commerce (mostly second hand) fraud

To combat fraud in marketplaces, we aim to enhance security measures by implementing a Chrome extension to flag suspicious messages and conversations. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, this proactive approach allows us identify, swiftly detect potentially fraudulent content and alert users or sellers accordingly. Our goal is to create a safer and more trustworthy environment for all marketplaces, fostering confidence and reducing the incidence of fraudulent transactions.
